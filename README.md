# Chester LUG Code Demos

You're looking at presentations and code examples written for talks
and demos at meetings of the Chester Linux User Group (LUG).

These files may be working code, non-working code, pseudocode, or
something else entirely. They are not nesessarily each month's events,
we may have skipped some; an indication in the filename or content
of the subject and speaker should be given.

Feel free to submit your own files, revisions, notes, whatever via
a Pull Request, and the Organisation admins will review.
