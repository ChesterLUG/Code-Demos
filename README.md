# Chester LUG Code Demos

You're looking all the code examples written for talks and demos at
meetings of the Chester Linux User Group (LUG).

These files may be working code, non-working code, pseudocode, or
something else entirely. They are structured in directories for each
month, eventhough we may have skipped some months' demos. Some
indication in the filename or content of the subject and speaker would
be great to help people remember them.

Feel free to submit your own files, revisions, notes, whatever via
a Pull Request, and the Organisation admins will review.
